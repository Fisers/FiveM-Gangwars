# FiveM-Gangwars
Gangwars mod for FiveM just like in SA-MP using leaflet maps

## Usage
- Writing in chat "/gzmap" opens a map to see all zones.
- Pressing M toggles a small radar on the bottom to better see which zone the player is in.
- Once player is in a faction, he can use /capture to win new territories
- (Work in progress) embedded hospital system
